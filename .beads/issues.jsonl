{"id":"gpt-code-review-pe8","title":"Add issue_comment event handler for /gpt-review trigger","description":"## Problem\n\nThe action only handles `pull_request.opened` and `pull_request.synchronize` events. It does NOT handle `issue_comment` events.\n\nLooking at `src/bot.ts` line 47:\n```typescript\napp.on(['pull_request.opened', 'pull_request.synchronize'], async (context) =\u003e {\n```\n\nWhen triggered via `/gpt-review` comment:\n1. Workflow runs with `issue_comment` event\n2. Action's Probot handler doesn't match any registered event type\n3. Action exits immediately without doing anything\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nUsers should be able to trigger code review on-demand by commenting `/gpt-review` on a PR.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd an `issue_comment.created` event handler that:\n1. Checks if the comment body contains `/gpt-review`\n2. Extracts the PR number from `context.payload.issue.number`\n3. Fetches PR details and runs the review\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `src/bot.ts` - Add issue_comment handler\n- `action.yml` - Document the new trigger capability\n- `README.md` - Add usage instructions for comment trigger","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-09T11:37:45.494360155-08:00","created_by":"m","updated_at":"2026-01-09T11:37:45.494360155-08:00"}
