# GPT-5.2 Models (recommended - requires API access)
# gpt-5.2-2025-12-11: Default model, excellent balance of quality and cost
# gpt-5.2-pro-2025-12-11: Premium tier for complex/critical reviews
#                         Note: Doesn't support structured outputs; JSON extracted from text

# GPT-5.1 Models (requires API access)
# gpt-5.1-codex: Optimized for code review and generation
# gpt-5.1-codex-mini: Cost-effective variant
# gpt-5.1: General purpose model

# Reasoning model settings (for GPT-5.2, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.1-Codex models)
# These settings only apply when using GPT-5.1+ models with the Responses API
REASONING_EFFORT=medium  # none, minimal, low, medium, high
VERBOSITY=medium         # low, medium, high
# Note: Higher reasoning effort = better quality but slower and more expensive
#       Recommended: medium for most use cases, high for critical reviews
